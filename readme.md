About opensourcefootball

opensourcefootball is an attempt to create an actual sport out of pick-up football, which is where players just agree to turn up on the day and play a game of football with no strings attached.

My goal is to try and make an actual sport out of this, by making it an alternative to sunday league football.
In this scenario, players are able to turn up and play whichever weeks they wish to, and aren't tied down to a game every sunday, but still have their own place on a league-table against other players.

The basic first draft for this is to generate a way of players signing up, creating events, committing to events, and viewing their W/L/D stats on a basic league table (again: the league table consists of players, not teams, the teams are randomly assigned from the pool of players).

Future expansion for this project include:
	- Probably a new name. Branding isn't my strong point.
	- Some fair way of monetizing it. Ideally I'd just like to be able to cover costs of pitch rental & supplying coloured bibs for players.
	- Building an algorithm for a sturdier divised league set-up where players "can" be catogorised based on their skill level (based off positive/negative contributions to previous games, sort of like ELO).
	- Expanding the league table to cater for more things like Passes/Tackles to assign points rather than the standard W3D1L0.
	- I'd also really like to build an application where teams can discuss formations/tactics with their other team mates.
